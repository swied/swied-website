## Introduction

The Bell telphone ringtone was a two second tone composed of the frequencies 440 Hz and 480 Hz. The tone was followed by a four second pause, and then repeated.  This ringtone continues to be used in the US with most mobile/landline carriers, and PBX systems.  Read more about this, and other international ringtones, at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_tone).

You can download a [recording of the US ringtone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_ringback_tone.ogg), which is now in the public domain.  Shown below is a demonstration of how to play this sound file within a Jupyter notebook.

```{python}
#| tags: []
from IPython.display import display, HTML, Audio
HTML("""<audio controls>
        <source 
          src="US_ringback_tone.ogg" 
          type="audio/ogg">
        </audio>""")
```

## Basics of audio frequencies

Let's start with some basics before jumping into recreating this ringtone.  

The [sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound) that we hear are produced by [longitudinal pressure waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_wave) in air particles.  These waves cause your ear drum to vibrate.  A [pure tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_tone) is produced when you hear an unchanging frequency with a [sinusoidal waveform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave). 

The basic equation of a sinusoidal waveform:

$y(t) = 
    sin
    \left({
        2 \pi f t
    }\right)$

Where, $t$ is the time value, and $f$ = wave frequency ([Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz)).

### Symbolic equations in Python

If you are exploring a problem it can be helpful to start with [symbolic computation](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/AlgebraicCalculations.html).  The [Sympy package](https://www.sympy.org/) in Python allows you to operate on and simplify algebraic equations.  Then, when you are ready, you can easily convert your equations into numerical formats (e.q., a Python list, or a Numpy array).

Define sinusoidal waveform equation as a symbolic equation.

```{python}
import sympy as s

# Define variables as Sympy symbols
t, f = s.symbols('t f')

# Define Sympy equation
y = s.sin(2*s.pi*t*f)

print(f"y = {y}")
```

### Musical notes

As a first example let's explore a couple of pure tones: 440 Hz ([A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard))), and 480 Hz (B4).

```{python}
# Substitue these frequencies in for f
y_at_440_hz = y.subs(f, 440)
y_at_480_hz = y.subs(f, 480)
```

```{python}
# Show the new equations
print(f"y_at_440_hz = {y_at_440_hz}")
print(f"y_at_480_hz = {y_at_480_hz}")
```

### Plot the notes A4 and B4 on a graph

Let's plot these example frequencies together on a graph.  Note that we don't have to transform our equations into numerical lists before plotting them.  Sympy does this for us.  We just need to provide a plot range.

```{python}
plot_range = (t, 0, 1/440)

# Plot the curve for A4
p = s.plot(
    y_at_440_hz, plot_range, 
    line_color='gray',
    title=f'Frequencies 440Hz, and 480Hz',
    show=False)

# Add the curve for B4 to the graph
p.extend(s.plot(
    y_at_480_hz, plot_range, 
    line_color='green',
    show=False, adaptive=False))

# Format the graph and display it
p.size = (6,5)
p.show()
```

### Convert Sympy equations into Python lists

In order to listen to these two notes we need to convert the equations into numerical time series.

```{python}
# Convert our Sympy equations into 
# Python lambda functions
lambda_y_440 = s.lambdify(t, y_at_440_hz)
lambda_y_480 = s.lambdify(t, y_at_480_hz)
```

```{python}
# Define numberic values for f1, and f2
f_440, f_480 = (440, 480)
# Number of samples per cycle
n = 50
# Number of seconds of play time
play_time = 3
# Sampling period in micro-seconds
t_440_delta = int(1e6/n/f_440)
t_480_delta = int(1e6/n/f_480) 
# Total play time in micro-seconds
t_max = int(play_time*1e6)
```

```{python}
# Iterators for each time series
ts_440_range = range(0, t_max, t_440_delta)
ts_480_range = range(0, t_max, t_480_delta)

# Generate numeric lists from lambda
# functions.  Note: time (t) values have 
# to be converted back into seconds.
ts_440 = [lambda_y_440(t/1e6) 
          for t 
          in ts_440_range]
ts_480 = [lambda_y_480(t/1e6) 
           for t 
           in ts_480_range]
```

### Play sounds for A4 and B4

```{python}
# from IPython.display import Audio
Audio(ts_440, rate=f_440*n)
```

```{python}
#| scrolled: true
Audio(ts_480, rate=f_480*n)
```

## Recreate the US ringtone

In the United States, the ringtone has historically been a two second tone composed of the frequencies 440 Hz and 480 Hz. The tone is followed by a four second pause, and then repeated until somebody answers.

### Acustic Equations

When multiple sound waves overlap, their amplitudes add together. This is called [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle).

$y_{super}(t) = 
    sin
    \left({
        2 \pi f_1 t
    }\right)
    +
    sin
    \left({
        2 \pi f_2 t
    }\right)$

Where, the [beat frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)) ($f_{beat}$) is defined as 

$f_{beat} = \lvert f_1 - f_2 \rvert$,

and the beat waveform equation ($y_{beat}$) is defined as

$y_{beat}(t) = 
    2 \cdot
    cos
    \left({
        2 \pi f_{beat} t
    }\right)$

```{python}
# Define variables as Sympy symbols
t, f = s.symbols('t f')

# Define Sympy equations
y = s.sin(2*s.pi*t*f)
y_beat = 2*s.cos(s.pi*t*f)
```

```{python}
# Define the two numeric frequencies
f1 = 440
f2 = 480
# Calculate beat frequency
f_beat = abs(f1-f2)

# Substitute in the numeric values
y_super = y.subs(f, f1) + y.subs(f, f2)
y_beat = y_beat.subs(f, f_beat)
```

```{python}
# Display the simplified equations
print(f"y_super = {y_super}")
print(f"y_beat = {y_beat}")
```

### Plot the superpositioned waveforms on a graph

Plot the superpositioned frequencies along with the curve for the beat frequency.

```{python}
plot_range = (t, 0, 2/f_beat)

# Plot the superpositioned waveform in gray
p = s.plot(
    y_super, plot_range, line_color='gray',
    title=f'Superposition {f1}Hz, and {f2}Hz',
    show=False, adaptive=False)

# Plot, on the same graph, the beat frequency 
# function in green.
p.extend(
    s.plot(y_beat, plot_range, 
           line_color='green', 
           show=False, adaptive=False))
p.size = (6,5)
p.show()
```

### Convert Sympy equations to numeric lists

```{python}
# Convert our Sympy equation into a
# Python lambda function
lambda_y_ringtone = s.lambdify(t, y_super)
```

```{python}
# Number of samples per cycle
n = 50
# Number of seconds of play time
play_time = 2
# Sampling period in micro-seconds
t_delta = int(1e6/n/max(f1,f2))
# Total play time in micro-seconds
t_max = int(play_time*1e6)
```

```{python}
# Create the time series as a list
ts_ringtone = [
   lambda_y_ringtone(t/1e6) 
   for t 
   in range(0,t_max, t_delta)]

pause_4sec = [
    0.0
    for t 
    in range(0,2*t_max,t_delta)]
```

### Play the ringtone sound

```{python}
audio_sampling_rate = max(f1,f2)*n

print('audio_sampling_rate =', 
      audio_sampling_rate, 'Hz')
```

```{python}
Audio(ts_ringtone + pause_4sec + ts_ringtone, 
      rate=audio_sampling_rate)
```
